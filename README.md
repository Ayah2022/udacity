## Welcome to memory game project

## What Will I Build?
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a snazzy, well-designed, and feature-packed memory game!

## How To Play

The game starts automatically upon page load. Click the cards to flip them. The goal is to flip cards two at a time to match the pairs.
The game ends when all pairs are matched.

## Scoring

**3** stars = **16** moves or less.  
**2** stars = **24** moves or more till 31 moves.  
**1** star =**32** moves or more. 

## How It Works  

If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.  

## Notice

This project is done as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). If you are like me and rather bad with styling, but wish to create your own version of the game, feel free to grab the starter files [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
